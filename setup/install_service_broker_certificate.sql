-- Certificates are used to provide the security context of OQS
-- This allows us to create a special user with minimal permissions
-- and also to ensure that the credentials can only be used for the
-- OQS stored procedure

-- Step 1:	Connect to the database where you previously installed OQS using the
--			official installer

USE [{DatabaseWhereOQSIsRunning}]
GO

-- We first create a certificate. Feel free to use a different password, but
-- the password is used only until we have signed the ActivateOQSScheduler
-- The START_DATE and EXPIRY_DATE as necessary to define the "lifetime" of
-- the certificate.

CREATE CERTIFICATE [open_query_store]
    ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'OQS1234!'
    WITH SUBJECT = 'OpenQueryStore Broker Certificate',
         START_DATE = '2017-06-01',
         EXPIRY_DATE = '2030-06-01';
GO

ADD SIGNATURE TO OBJECT::[oqs].[activate_oqs_scheduler] BY CERTIFICATE [open_query_store] WITH PASSWORD = 'OQS1234!';
GO

ALTER CERTIFICATE [open_query_store] REMOVE PRIVATE KEY;
GO

-- Change the file location to a valid value
-- This needs to be a full folder and filename
-- e.g. C:\Temp\OpenQueryStore.CER
BACKUP CERTIFICATE [open_query_store] TO FILE = '{Enter A File Location accessible by the SQL Server Service Account}';
GO


-- We now move to the master database to import the certificate and associate it with
-- an otherwise unused login: OpenQueryStore

USE [master]
GO

-- Enter the file location previously used to create the certificate
CREATE CERTIFICATE [open_query_store] FROM FILE = '{Enter A File Location accessible by the SQL Server Service Account}';
GO

-- Create the login using the certificate
CREATE LOGIN [open_query_store] FROM CERTIFICATE [open_query_store];
GO

-- Assign the permissions to OpenQueryStore
GRANT AUTHENTICATE SERVER TO [open_query_store];
GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO [open_query_store];
GO

-- We are now ready to use OQS inside a secure context
