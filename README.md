OpenQueryStore (OQS) is a collection of scripts that add Query Store like functionality to pre-SQL Server 2016 Instances!

OQS is being built from the ground up to allow **all versions and editions** of SQL Server from **2005** up to and including **2014** to have a Query Store like functionality. The data collection, retention and cleanup will be easily configurable to allow for complete control of the OQS data storage.

The plan is to offer a fully integrated OQS functionality that requires minimal administration, including persistence of query data across restarts and backups/restores.

A further option will allow for a centralized query store, to collect all query statistics for an entire SQL Server instance.

Finally, a set of integrated reports inside SQL Server Management Studio will allow for analysis of the collected data.
